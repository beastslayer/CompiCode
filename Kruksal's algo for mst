1.Let there be n vertices.
2.Then we create n disjoint sets each representing the vertices.
3.Sort the edges in the non decreasing order.
4.Iterate through the edges and if the vertices are not in same set then include the edge in final result and merge the 2 disjoint sets.
5.If the vertices of the edge belong to the same set then ignore the edge and move continue.
6.Do this until you have all the edges covered.
